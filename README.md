My solutions to the [2023 Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) problems. 

I have wanted to use [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for a long time and have never really had a reason to use it. I thought it would be a good intro for myself to try to learn it and do these problems. Basically this is me saying: please ignore poor Rust practices, I am only a beginner.
